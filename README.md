Some handy scripts that I use.


`dd`
===
Opens up the GoDuckGo search engine in the `lynx` CLI browser showing search results for a word that you pass. 

Usage: `dd test` opens search results for the word "test".

`wiki`
===
Same but with Wikipedia

`dict`
===
Same but with Merriam Webster dictionary.

`dev-tmux`
===
Launches a new `tmux` session with my predefined window layout for Web development (won't work for you, but you can customize it).

`git-commit-branch`
===
Creates a new git branch with the name you pass and commits the current changes there. 

Usage: `git-commit-branch New-branch-name`


`git-push-branch`
===

Same but also pushes the changes.

`git-push-stuff`
===
Commits and push current changes with a predefined message.

`rv`
==
Searches for a word or a phrase in current dir, using `ripgrep` and opens all results in `vim` in separate tabs with the word highlighted.

Usage: `rv <<<<` opens up all files with merge conflicts.

`vt`
===
Just `vim ~/temp.md` - a handy solution for keeping notes.
